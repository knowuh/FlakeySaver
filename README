This is another old old old project. 

because I was dusting off VidFreaker, I thought I should dust this one off
too.

It seems to work on 10.6 now.

I basically checked in the entire xcode directory, only ignoring the build directories.

There are better practices for sharing xcode
projects on github I am sure, so please let me know.
